# web3-blog

## Overview
A web3 decentralised blogging/posting app with complete anonymity

## Purpose 
There are many centralizd platforms for blog posting but in order to access them you need to input your personal information which is then  stored in a centralized database and can be used against you or be breached by a third party, but Web3Blog provides complete anonimity and resistance against cencorship with a friendly UI.
